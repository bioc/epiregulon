# Introduction

Gene regulatory networks model the underlying gene regulation hierarchies that drive gene expression and cell states. The main function of the epiregulon package is to construct gene regulatory networks and infer transcription factor (TF) activity in single cells by integration of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data and incorporation of public bulk TF ChIP-seq data.

For full documentation, please refer to the epiregulon [book](https://xiaosaiyao.github.io/epiregulon.book/).

There are three related packages. The core epiregulon package supports `SingleCellExperiment` objects. If the users would like to start from `ArchR` projects, they may choose to use `epiregulon.archr` package, which allows for the seamless integration with the [ArchR](https://www.archrproject.com/) package. Moreover, we provide a suite of tools in `epiregulon.extra` package for the enrichment analysis, visualization, and network analysis which can be run on the `epireglon` or `epiregulon.archr` output.

# Installation

```
if(!require(BiocManager)) install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("epiregulon")
```

# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

The epiregulon package has been tested on a standard MacBook with 16GB of RAM and 8 cores
